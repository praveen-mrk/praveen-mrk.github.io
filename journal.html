                <li>In the morning session , I rewatched LWC's first video and the aura videos , and I practised by creating components on my home and record page ,App page .</li>
                <li>I learnt basics of Lwc by practicing in trailhead ,and i practiced some examples like creating calculator in lwc in home page .</li>
			    <li>I practised how to add buttons using lwc . I tried with different lightning buttons with different labels and styles.</li>
				<li>Yesterday, the trainer sent one document link. I studied from there and practised some examples that were given in the component library.</li>

                <li>In the morning session, the trainer started the Lightining web components, explained the basics of LWC, and explained the advantages of LWC over Aura components, which are fast loading , easier to ramp for developers , and better performance. and has more standards, explained by showing the meta config file and lighting web components.</li>
                <li>With the help of a simple example, the trainer explained how to create an lwc component in Vs code and call it into the Salesforce org using the "Hello World" example .and explained the basics of how to change the background color and font colours.</li>
			    <li>I learnt how to show the lwc component on the home page , record page ,and app page for that used targets in the meta file,.and explained, with a calculator example, how to show the components, like using a lighting card to show the title name "calculator", then using lighting input type text to enter the first number and second number.</li>
				<li>I learnt conditional rendering in the LWC. It is used when we want to hide some of the components from html and show it  based on a condition, using (template if:true|false={property}>) here property is in boolean.</li>
				<li>I learnt the rendering list in LWC. To render the list of items, we use the For:each directive or the iterator.Whenever we use for:each or Iterator we need to use a key directive on the element on which we are doing iteration.To apply special behaviour like first / last element to the list we should use iterator over the loop,like iterator:iteratorName={list/array}.</li>
				<li>The trainer explained the component composition. In that explained  how to add one component to the other component.</li>

                <li>In the morning session , I learnt about the navigation that can be done for the app home page, object list view page, and custom component. The Navigation event enables you to navigate to an sObject record specified by Id.  with the help of notice example  trainer explained How to Use NotificationsLibrary to Display Toast and Notice.</li>
                <li>After that, the trainer explained the helper method and inheritance in the helper method. To improve the code ,a helper function can be called from JS code and written in the helper.js file . We have to write extensible=true in the component by using extends keywords in another component also and it should be implemented.</li>
			    <li>I learnt about the aura method in that used  <aura : method>. We can use the aura method for passing data from a parent component controller to a child component controller.</li>
                <li>With the help of examples, the trainer explained the Aura Method, in which I learnt how to create a method. First we need to create a child component with the aura: method , then create a child class controller to get the argument ,then create a parent component and in that create a button to call the aura method. After that, we have to create an application in which we have to call the parent component.</li>
                <li>I learnt about the Tabset, which is used in your component to create tabs.explained with example(to add hospital name and save for that created tab),used in example like ( lightning:tabset variant="horizontal"selectedTabId="two").</li>

                <li>In the morning session, the trainer explained about component events and application events.A component event is used when there is a parent-child relationship between two or more components.component can intract with each other and that too are nested.The event is registered in the child component and handled by the parent component.An application event is used when two components are independent.In application events, they do not require any kind of relationship between components. </li>
                <li>With the help of an example, the trainer explained how to create the component event and how to register that event on the child component.registered event handle by the aura: handler in another component called the parent component.In the parent component, you have to call the child explicitly .To preview the component event, you have to create the lightning app and call only by the parent component,as it has been in a relationship with the child component.</li>
				<li>After that, I learnt about LDS(lightning data service). We used LDS whenever we wanted to create, edit, or delete a record in our component, and it works on a single record only. There are four types of LDS, such as lightning:recordForm, lightning: recordeditform, lightning: recordviewform, and lightning:recordData.</li>
                <li>With the help of an example (to display account records with related contacts), the trainer explained four types of Lightning data services  Lightning:recordform is used to create, display, and edit the records, Lightning: recordviewform is used to display the record and the record is in read-only format. Lightning:recordEditform is used to create and edit the record. With this form, we are able to edit the record. Lightning:recordData is used to create, update, edit, or delete the record data.</li>
                <li>I learnt about the spinners in lighting. To show the page is loading, we use a spinner (< lightning:spinner alternativeText="Loading....." />) </li>

                <li>After that, the trainer explained the concept of toast messages. A toast displays a message below the header at the top of a view. Using force: show toast, we can display a toast notification with a message. The message is specified by the message attribute.In toast, having some attributes like success, error, warning, and information,title,message.with different colour.</li>
				<li>The trainer explained the use of setcallback ,setparam and $A.enqueueAction (It is used to add the server-side controller action to the queue of actions to be executed). and setParam is used to pass the data to an apex.</li>
                <li>After that, I learnt about aura: handler, which sets the client-side controller action to handle the event, which is automatically fired when the component is invoked.</li>
                <li>I learnt about events in aura components. There are two types of events: component events and application events. Events can contain attributes that can be set before the event is fired and read when the event is handled. Events are declared by the aura:event tag.</li>
				<li>After that,For DevOps training ,I installed the Apache Ant tool as suggested by trainer.in that I set the path in enviromental variable with ANT_HOME name.</li>

                <li>In the morning session,trainer explained remaining part of integration that is REST Api ,SOAP Api ,I learnt how to insert the outside data in to inside org by using rest api.In that used req.SetBody for sending data in format which you want to pass the key value.After that trainer explained soap api and how to insert data by using soap api.</li>
                <li>After that, I learnt about the  Apex asynchronous ,asynchronous runs in background ,and it waits until the resources availability when the resources is available its get executed.in that trainer explained the types of asynchronous they are batch apex , schedule batch ,future method , and queueable apex.</li>
				<li>Batch apex is used for processing bulk records , and also explained how to write batch apex for that class must implement the database. batchable interface and includes 3 methods ( start , execute, and finish). The default batch size is 200 records. It ranges from 1 to 10,000 for a single batch.and also explained it has the double governor limit.</li>
                <li>After that, trainer explained how to schedule a batch using Schedule apex with syntax and Scheduled apex is used for scheduling the methods and the class must be implemented with Schedulable interface and To schedule the batch apex there are 2 methods by configuration and by using CRON operation.explained how to write CRON expression and wrote an apex class that implements the schedulable interface and scheduled it for execution on a specific schedule.</li>
                <li>I learnt about the future method for executing long-running operations to make a web service callout from an apex trigger. It must be annotated as @future, then only it can be executed. Methods with the future annotation must be static and can only return void data types.</li>
                <li>After that, the trainer explained the queueable method, queueable apex is similar to the @future method . In this case, we can make batch chaining in the execute method. By using this queueable interface, we can process an Apex that runs for a long time (such as web service call outs and extensive database operations).</li> 
				<li>I learnt the access modifiers like (try,catch,finally )using simple apex examples. The trainer explained how to use try-catch blocks. These are used to recover from a thrown exception.</li>
